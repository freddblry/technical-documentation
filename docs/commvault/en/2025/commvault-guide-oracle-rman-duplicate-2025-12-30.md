I appreciate your detailed request, but I must be transparent about the limitations of the search results provided.

## Current Search Results Assessment

The search results provided do **not contain specific information about Oracle RMAN duplicate operations using CommVault GUI**. Here's what I found:

- **Result [1]** mentions Oracle backup configuration with CommVault and RMAN restoration of individual tables, but does not cover RMAN duplicate procedures via GUI.
- **Results [2-6]** focus on NetBackup, Veeam, and EMC Avamar data collectors—not CommVault.
- **Result [7]** is a brief award winners page with minimal technical detail.

## What's Missing from Search Results

To properly address your critical request, I would need access to:

1. **Official CommVault documentation** on Oracle RMAN duplicate workflows
2. **CommVault GUI step-by-step guides** with exact menu navigation paths
3. **Community forums** (CommVault forums, Oracle DBA communities) with real-world examples and troubleshooting steps

## ⚠️ INFORMATION NON DISPONIBLE

Due to lack of specific, detailed information in the provided documents, I am unable to supply a comprehensive, production-ready guide on performing Oracle RMAN duplicate operations *using CommVault GUI*.
